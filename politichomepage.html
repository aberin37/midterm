               <li><a href="Politics.html">Supreme Court Strengthens government's power to jail immigrants who face deportation</a></span><p><span class="headline hl4">by David C. Savage</span></p></div>
          The Supreme Court on Tuesday strengthened the Trump administration's power to hold immigrants in jail for months or years as they fight deportation, ruling federal law gives these detainees no right to a bail hearing nor a chance to go free.
In the 5-3 decision, the court's majority found that federal law says immigrants who face deportation "shall be detained" while their cases are being considered. The court's conservatives rejected the view of federal judges in California who said detained immigrants have a right to a bail hearing after six months in jail. The case of Jennings vs. Rodriguez began in lower courts a decade ago, before Barack Obama was elected president. It was first argued at the high court in November 2016, a few weeks after Donald Trump won election. Trump's campaign pledge to round up and deport more immigrants had raised the stakes in the case.
At the end of the last term, the court said it would rehear the case in the current term, presumably to allow the newly arrived Justice Neil M. Gorsuch to cast a vote.
Even after an unusually long time to reach a decision, the court issued only a partial ruling.
Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., speaking for the high court, said the federal immigration law does not call for bail hearings, and the 9th Circuit had no authority to order them.
However, the justices did not rule on whether the Constitution gives detained immigrants a right to a hearing, and it sent the case back to California for that issue to be decided.
Justice Stephen Breyer read his dissent in court and said the ruling would affect thousands of people in jail "who believe they have a right to enter or remain in the United States. … This court, I think for first time ever, reads a statute as permitting long-term confinement of a 'person' in the United States without an opportunity to obtain bail."
As he noted, the Constitution says no person "shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law," and the word "person" has been understood to include non-citizens and immigrants who are here illegally.
Cornell law professor Stephen Yale-Loehr said court data show "there are over 667,000 cases pending in immigration court, with an average backlog of almost two years. The Trump administration has asked Congress to increase funding to detain more immigrants. Thus, even more immigrants may be detained in the coming months and will have to wait even longer for their day in court."
ACLU attorney Ahilan Arulanantham, who argued the case in the high court, said the "Trump administration is trying to expand immigration detention to record-breaking levels as part of its crackdown on immigrant communities. … We look forward to going back to the lower courts to show that these statutes, now interpreted by the Supreme Court to require detention without any hearing, violate the Due Process Clause."

         With its internet-connected doorbells, Ring promises customers not just a nifty piece of technology, but also a sense of trust and security.
With its latest plan to allow couriers to enter customers' homes and drop off packages, Amazon faces a major hurdle: a lack of trust and security.
It's not hard to see, then, why Amazon is acquiring the Santa Monica start-up in a deal reportedly worth more than $1 billion.
The sale gives Amazon new tools as it pushes further into consumers' homes. The e-commerce giant is dabbling with a new in-home delivery service called Amazon Key. If successful, it could eradicate the scourge of package theft. If unsuccessful, it could erode consumer trust in its business.

Ring's camera-equipped doorbells, which let owners remotely see who's at the door via a smartphone app, could give hesitant Amazon shoppers some reassurance.
Although most people think of Amazon as a retail giant, the company has been quietly acquiring technology to bolster its smart home capabilities.
Amazon currently has Alexa, the home speaker that also doubles as an artificial intelligence device that can answer questions and make Amazon purchases. In 2015 it acquired smart lawn sprinkler company Rachio. That same year it also acquired home security company Scout Alarm.
The acquisition of Ring also gives Amazon more ammunition to take on rival Google, which is expanding into video doorbells soon with its line of smart home hardware called Nest.
"Amazon's really watering the grass, so to speak, to grow into our homes and become more integrated in our lives in ways we haven't even fathomed yet," said Matt Schreiber, president and chief investment strategist at WBI. "This isn't just about Ring's doorbell technology. It ties into all the acquisitions they've quietly made over the years.

            <p>"They want Alexa to be the brain of your home. They've envisioned Alexa as your personal assistant, as your butler, as the hired help without having a hired help. This is the help for everyone on the planet, and they're not done yet."
With investments in so many industries — retail, grocery, hardware, AI — it's not a stretch to imagine a future where someone can tell Alexa to buy them groceries, and an Amazon drone performs the delivery from Whole Foods, Schreiber said.
"This is like 'I, Robot,'" Schreiber said, referring to the 2004 science fiction film starring Will Smith in which humans create robots to serve as personal assistants. "Hopefully the robots won't take over, though. That would be terrifying."/p>

           <span class="citation">""Scarlet has a fever," the nurse told Rebecca Hendricks. "She's lying down now. If you could come get her."</span>  Hendricks brought her 5-year-old home, gave her some Tylenol, brought her some soup and let her snuggle up on the coach as she started preparing dinner for the family. By the next day, Hendricks and her 2-year-old twins began to feel sick too.
"Everybody's dying in this house, we're so sick," she wrote with dramatic effect on Facebook.
</p>
            <p>The following day, Scarlet Anne seemed to be improving. She ate Cap'n Crunch for breakfast, drank her milk and curled up on the couch with her mother to watch "The Aristocats."
Thirty minutes into the Disney movie, the child fell asleep. Alarmed by her labored and raspy breathing, Hendricks woke her up. She dressed the child in footy pajamas, put her hair in pigtails and rushed her to the emergency room.
Three and half hours later, the little girl with the irresistible giggle, long brown hair and piercing blue eyes was dead.
